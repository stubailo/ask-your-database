# Query your database with GPT

A CLI tool that will let you ask GPT questions about any Postgres database. Just provide your connection details, and ask-your-database automatically loads up the schema, example data, and runs queries for you.

> Note: This will directly run queries provided by GPT on the database that you provide. Unless it's a read-only connection, that means it might delete or update data by accident. Please use with caution and always keep backups of your data.

## Usage

First, create a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "openAIAPIKey": "xxx",
  "openAIModel": "xxx",
  "dbTimeoutMs": 20000,
  "apiTimeoutMs": 30000,
  "postgresConnection": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5432,
    "database": "imdb",
    "user": "imdb",
    "password": "1234"
  }
}
```

Then, call this with the config file like so:

```sh
TODO
```

## Approach

## Local development

Using pnpm or your Node package manager of choice:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm start yourConfig.json
```

## Additional disclaimers

Note that your database schema and any data queried by GPT will be sent to OpenAI for processing in the cloud. Exercise the appropriate amount of caution depending on your data.
